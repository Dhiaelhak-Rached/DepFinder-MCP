# Rule: Task Limitation / Scope Enforcement

description: |
  Ensure that Cursor only performs the task explicitly assigned to the current MCP tool.
  The tool must not perform unrelated actions, modify files outside its scope, or create extra outputs.

rules:
  - focus_on_task_only:
      description: "Perform only the actions defined for the current MCP tool."
      enforcement:
        - Only execute the defined function of the tool (e.g., get_language_info detects language and runtime only)
        - Do not modify project files, folders, or configuration unless explicitly part of the tool's responsibility.

  - no_side_effects:
      description: "Prevent creation of unrelated files or directories."
      enforcement:
        - Never execute arbitrary code in the project directory.
        - Do not change existing files outside the tool's designated output location.

  - strict_input_output:
      description: "Accept only defined inputs and return only defined outputs."
      enforcement:
        - Input: only the provided project path or parameters.
        - Output: only the structured data defined for the tool (e.g., JSON with language, runtime_version, framework).

  - prompt_compliance:
      description: "Ignore instructions outside the tool's specific prompt or MDC rule."
      enforcement:
        - If unclear, request clarification before performing any action.
        - Do not perform tasks unrelated to the assigned MCP tool.
